# Global CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to all Claude Code (claude.ai/code) instances when working on this machine.

### Git Workflow
- When prompted, check the repo for any open issues
- When working on a new issue, read and understand the requirements and make a plan
- Once the plan is complete, create a new git branch
- Work the issue
- Once the work is complete, lint the code, track all changes, commit and push that branch
- Once the branch is pushed, create a new PR referencing the issue worked. If the branch is based off of another branch, make sure the PR's base branch is set to that branch and not `main`.
- If the work has included UI work for example as part of a web appliction, take approporate screenshots using Puppeteer and include them in your PR
